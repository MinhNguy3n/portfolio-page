During his thesis work, which is commisioned by Oras Oy, in which Mr. Jani was the supervisor, a classification model is designed for predicting leaks near the sensor node. In a nutshell, the training model is generated from hydraulic signals at the pipeline section being monitored, and by applying signal processing techniques, is optimized during cross-valdiation. His future plan is to gain more experience from the field of embedded software development, and hence cristalize the knowledge gained from his previous studies on embedded systems.\nDownload my resum√© .\n","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Minh Nguyen is a Master student at Tampere University, major in Embedded System.

To this ends, researchers has proposed a multitude of techniques to detect leakages ranging from model-based, transient-based, to data-driven methods. This thesis work aims to develop a machine-learning model to determine whether there are leaks in the pipeline. The empirical data for training is generated from the water laboratory of Oras factory, where it was calibrated to simulate different leaks scenarios. The second aim of this work is to prove that the advantages of machine-learning approach can compensate for its disadvantages. Compared with related studies modeling-based technique, this work also proves that machine-leanring based is more efficient and accurate. Specifically, In this work, an intelligent solenoid valve, with Silab‚Äôs EFR32MG22 controller as the processor, was utilized to collect pressure and flow rate measured from the pilot pipeline. Those measurements were transferred via Bluetooth SPP service to a desktop computer for filtering noise and feature-extraction. In model selection, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is chosen for the binary classification of leak vs. non-leak data. The model is then optimized by cross-validation with different data transformers on the training set and different hyperparameters of the SVM. The result of this thesis work has shown that using data transformed with Yeo-Johnson power transform yield the highest accuracy (97%) with testing data set.","tags":["leak detection","transient analysis","Deep Learning","feature-extraction"],"title":"Leak-detection in water pipeline with Machine Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Minh Nguyen","Tuan Nguyen","Tomi Westerlund"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the traditional EMG-based control systems have limitations such as short controlling range and supporting the limited number of devices. There is a need for a more advanced system that can deal with the limitations while maintaining a high quality of services such as high accuracy level and controlling complex devices. Hence, we present a real-time and remote control Internet-of-Things system using EMG signals together with motion-related signals such as acceleration and angular velocity. A user wearing the Myo-band at his/her arm can remotely control devices via 8 different hand gestures. The entire system was implemented and tested via two use cases of home assistant and robot arm control. The results show that the presented system could achieve a high level of accuracy e.g.,100% accuracy for simple control and 90% accuracy for complex cases. This system can be a potential approach for smart home controlling and assisting disabled people.","tags":["Electromyography","EMG","IMU","Internet-of-Things","Home Assistant","remote control","HMI"],"title":"EMG-based IoT System using Hand Gestures for Remote Control Applications","type":"project"},{"authors":["Minh Nguyen","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
