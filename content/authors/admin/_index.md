Minh Nguyen is a Master student at Tampere University, major in Embedded System. His research interests include ambient intelligent, health monitoring and machine learning with embedded devices. At the end of his Bachelor degree, he worked as a visiting research assistant at TIERS group in University of Turku, where he completed his bachelor thesis project with the help of Mr. Tuan, a senior member of the group at the time. He later on submitted his work to the IEEE IoT 2021 Conference and was accepted for Lecture presentation. During his thesis work, which is commisioned by Oras Oy, in which Mr. Jani was the supervisor, a classification model is designed for predicting leaks near the sensor node. In a nutshell, the training model is generated from hydraulic signals at the pipeline section being monitored, and by applying signal processing techniques, is optimized during cross-valdiation. His future plan is to gain more experience from the field of embedded software development, and hence cristalize the knowledge gained from his previous studies on embedded systems.
